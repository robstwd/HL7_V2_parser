# HL7 v2.3.1 Message Parser

This is my attempt at learning a bunch of things - [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [RSpec](http://relishapp.com/rspec), [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as well as some of the details within the [HL7 V2 specifications](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=185).

As such, it is certainly not intended to be anything other than my own learnings as a beginner of all the items mentioned above.
