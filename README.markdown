# HL7 Parser

This is my attempt at learning a bunch of things - [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/); [RSpec](http://relishapp.com/rspec), [Git](http://relishapp.com/rspec) as well as some of the details within the [HL7 specifications](http://www.hl7.org.au/HL7-V2-Resources.htm).

As such, it is certainly not intended to be anything other than my own learnings as a beginner of all the items mentioned above.
